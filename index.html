                Hi, my name is Ben Kolera and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer
                in love with the safety and composability of Functional
                Programming. You can find more about me and my story,
                <a href="/about.html">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of this blog is to share my thoughts and the message
                that Functional Programming gives a lot of wins even for stock
                standard web programming. You do not need to be a computer
                scientist to appreciate Haskell!! More on why I love Haskell
                <a href="/posts/2015-09-13-why_haskell.html">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also co-organise the <a href="http://bfpg.org/">Brisbane FP
                Group</a> and speak there semi-regularly, so I'll also record my
                talks <a href="/talks.html">here</a>.
